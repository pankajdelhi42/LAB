int    4
long   8

floating

float

float price = 999.99f

contain data

displayStudent

method

reading data from console

- no need of class reference to access or to call
- it can be access directly using the method name or classname.methodname;

non static method
need class referece to call or to access


reading data from console

class Scanner
{
public  int nextInt()
{


---

--

read from consol
}

}


Scanner s = new Scanner()
s.nextInt()
